# Object Tracking - Computer Vision

This project demonstrates the implementation of object tracking using OpenCV, leveraging different tracking algorithms such as KCF and CSRT. The purpose of the project is to apply computer vision techniques to track a user-defined object in a video, providing real-time tracking results along with performance metrics like FPS.

## Process

- Implemented multiple object tracking algorithms, including KCF and CSRT.
- Processed a video file and applied tracking to a user-defined region.
- Visualized tracking results with bounding boxes and FPS metrics overlaid on the video frames.
- Exported processed videos for both KCF and CSRT tracking methods.

### Results

The project successfully tracks an object throughout the video, depending on the selected algorithm.


## Technologies
